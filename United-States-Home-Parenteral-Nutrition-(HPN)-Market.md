The prevalence of congenital diseases, malabsorption syndromes, and conditions like short bowel syndrome among neonates further drives the demand for this therapy. While the complexity of neonatal care is high, improvements in safety protocols, as well as better parent education and support systems, have made home-based nutrition therapy more feasible for this vulnerable population. The market for neonatal HPN is expected to see substantial growth as the trend toward home-based care becomes more common, providing a significant opportunity for market players to develop more effective and accessible solutions for this patient group.</p> <h2>Geriatrics</h2> <p>The geriatric segment is another key driver of the Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) market in the United States. As the population ages, an increasing number of elderly patients are experiencing chronic health conditions, such as cancer, neurological disorders, or gastrointestinal diseases, that impair their ability to absorb nutrients from food. For these patients, home parenteral nutrition provides a viable solution to ensure that they receive adequate nutrition outside of a hospital setting. HPN therapy for geriatric patients requires careful management to balance the nutritional requirements and avoid potential complications like infections or electrolyte imbalances. This segment is significant because of the rapid increase in the aging population and the growing prevalence of chronic diseases that necessitate long-term nutritional support. <p>With the geriatric population increasing at a rapid pace, particularly in the baby boomer demographic, the demand for home healthcare services, including HPN, is expected to rise.
